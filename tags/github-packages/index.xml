Itâ€™s basically hooks that can start CI/DC workflows on repository events.
GitHub actions can be used to build and push images to GitHubs Container Registry which are reachable under https://ghcr.io which is part of the package registry. The package registry is not only for docker images, it can also host quite a few other kinds of packages.</description></item></channel></rss>
