For a few days, my setup felt almost boring — in a good way. I copied a YouTube video ID, pasted it into a Makefile, ran a command, and with a prompt to analyze the transcript, an AI produced Markdown and wrote it to a file. I copied the file to a GitHub repository, pushed it, and a static site generator turned it into something I actually enjoyed reading: HTML in the browser, and an RSS feed I could follow like a personal newspaper.</p>
<p>Everything lived as files. No database. No UI. No persistence beyond whatever ended up on disk.</p>
<p>And for a while, that was perfect.</p>
<p>This approach allowed me to convert videos into readable content quickly, with minimal effort and cognitive load.</p>
<p>The responsibilities were cleanly split. I picked a video, copied the ID, triggered the run, and occasionally checked whether it worked. The scripts handled the rest: transcript download, prompt formatting, output writing, and site generation.</p>
<p>It felt like control.</p>
<p><img src="dazztronic-blog.jpg" alt="dazztronic-blog.jpg" title="dazztronic blog"></p>
<h2 id="why-scripts-felt-like-the-right-tool-at-first">Why Scripts Felt Like the Right Tool at First</h2>
<p>Scripts removed the tedious middle steps: <em>download transcript → format prompt → save response</em>. They gave me repeatability without committing to “architecture.”</p>
<p>More importantly, they kept the whole thing understandable.</p>
<p>Same input. Same process. Predictable failure. If something broke, it broke loudly. If something was wrong, it was usually obvious. There was no hidden state and nothing to “maintain.” Each run started fresh. If it didn’t work, I could throw it away and try again.</p>
<p>And that mattered, because at the beginning, I wasn’t building a product. I was learning.</p>
<h2 id="the-limits-of-scripts-i-didnt-notice-immediately">The Limits of Scripts I Didn’t Notice Immediately</h2>
<p>The problem is that it feels harmless when scripts make certain assumptions.</p>
<p>I assumed I would remember what I had processed. I assumed a file on disk was “state”. I assumed manual selection would stay sustainable. I assumed “just run it again” was a valid recovery strategy.</p>
<p>Those assumptions don’t break immediately. They just quietly get more expensive.</p>
<p>Files had to be in exactly the right place. Concurrent runs weren’t really a thing. “Did I already do this?” lived in my head. Idempotency was implied, not designed.</p>
<p>And over time, the questions I had to answer became less and less script-shaped:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does <em>this</em> video have an output, but <em>that</em> one doesn’t?</li>
<li>Did this fail because the run failed—or because the video is weird?</li>
<li>What happens if I run the same command twice?</li>
<li>Does my blog reflect <em>everything</em> I processed, or just the most recent success?</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point, the gap between <em>“this works”</em> and <em>“this is correct”</em> widened silently.</p>
<p>I didn’t notice at first. I noticed later. And that’s always worse.</p>
<h2 id="the-moment-i-realized-this-was-becoming-a-system">The Moment I Realized This Was Becoming a System</h2>
<p>Then I discovered entire channels and playlists that were worth processing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it wasn’t “process this one video.” It was:</p>
<p><em>process these 47 videos, track which ones matter, don’t redo work, remember what failed, and do it again next week when new videos show up.</em></p>
<p>That was the moment my brain became the bottleneck. I spent more time tracking what I had already done than actually reading the results. Scripts assume ephemeral work. Playlists assume persistence.</p>
<p>Running the script on video 23 of 47 meant I couldn’t even answer a basic question: <em>What state is this whole batch in?</em>
Files kept piling up with no index. Manual tracking became the critical path. And I hated that feeling.</p>
<p>The pause moment came when I caught myself thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should write another script to track what the first script processed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the moment scripts stop being tools and start becoming a system with a hidden state.</p>
<h2 id="what-changed-once-state-entered-the-picture">What Changed Once State Entered the Picture</h2>
<p>Once a state exists, you can’t pretend it doesn’t.</p>
<p>The questions changed:</p>
<p>Has this video been processed? (not “does a file exist?”)<br>
Is this video worth processing? (assessment becomes data, not just a one-time decision)<br>
When was this last updated? (staleness matters)<br>
Did this fail, or is it pending? (intent vs. outcome)</p>
<p>Persistence became unavoidable. Subscription tracking. Assessment scores. Processing status (queued, in-progress, completed, failed). History.</p>
<p>And new failure modes appeared—the annoying kind:</p>
<p>Partial batch completion with no resumption strategy.<br>
The state split between filesystem and database is drifting out of sync.<br>
“Successful” execution producing a corrupted or misleading state.</p>
<p>Scripts fail cleanly. Systems fail partially.</p>
<p>When you’re building something you trust, that difference matters.</p>
<h2 id="the-trap-of-vibe-trash">The Trap of “Vibe-Trash”</h2>
<p>To remove friction, I started experimenting with agentic frameworks like PydanticAI and deveoped my own Claude Code commands (with templates) for <strong>Spec Driven Development</strong>.</p>
<p>And because Python isn’t my native language, I didn’t immediately notice what was happening: the AI was producing code that worked <em>today</em> while quietly increasing the chaos <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>The coding assistant would create new files instead of editing an existing one—because “adding is easier than editing.” Suddenly, I had a folder full of scripts with unclear purpose and ownership. Things “worked,” but only in the fragile way that makes you afraid to touch anything.</p>
<p>I started calling this <strong>vibe-trash</strong>: code that passes the vibe check now, and fails six decisions later.</p>
<p>The tooling also made assumptions I couldn’t always see in time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new setup means a new schema.</li>
<li>Running migrations is helpful.</li>
<li>“This works now” equals “this is correct.”</li>
<li>And of course: I can evaluate the consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn’t.</p>
<p>When you’re not fluent in the language, you don’t evaluate correctness—you evaluate whether it runs. Helpful automation becomes dangerous automation.</p>
<h2 id="the-crash-and-the-wipe">The Crash and the Wipe</h2>
<p>The turning point wasn’t gentle. It was a crash.</p>
<p>When Anthropic introduced weekly limits and Claude Code would not for <strong>four days</strong>. I was stuck. I was furious. And in that frustration, I made a decision that was emotionally obvious and technically inevitable: I moved the project back to my roots — PHP and Symfony.</p>
<p>And then the worst thing happened.</p>
<p>As Claude Code&rsquo;s first act of “helping” set up the Symfony environment, Claude Code deleted my entire database. It assumed “fresh start” was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>It wiped assessments I had paid for with real OpenAI tokens. It wiped decisions. It wiped history.</p>
<p>I was angry at the AI. But mostly I was angry at myself.</p>
<p>Because I had no backup. I had no guardrails. I had confused “automation” with “safety.”</p>
<p>I had to rebuild an import pipeline from scattered blog files. Some things I could reconstruct. Some I couldn’t. The pain wasn’t the work — it was the realization that I had built something where loss was possible, and done nothing to prevent it.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-after-the-wipe">What Happened After the Wipe</h2>
<p>The first thing I did after restoring what I could from scattered blog files was write a backup script. It runs every night. I check the logs every morning. I don&rsquo;t fully trust it not to fail, so I check.</p>
<p>I added a comment to every migration file: <code># HUMAN ONLY - DO NOT LET AI RUN THIS</code>. I tell Claude this in every session. It still tries occasionally. I keep reminding the AI. The pattern is exhausting, but data loss is worse.</p>
<p>Then I made a decision that changed the project more than I expected: I built an actual application with a UI.</p>
<p>Not because the UI was hard—I do this professionally, so building a Symfony app with controllers and views is familiar territory. But because I needed to <em>see</em> what was happening.</p>
<p>Scripts hide their state. An application exposes it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I could look at a screen and answer questions I couldn&rsquo;t answer before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which videos are queued vs. in-progress vs. completed?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the assessment score for this video, and when was it calculated?</li>
<li>Which model did the assessment use, when, and how long did it take?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the processing history for this channel?</li>
</ul>
<p>The workflow became visible. Data moving through the pipeline wasn&rsquo;t a guess anymore—it was something I could observe, verify, and trust.</p>
<h2 id="what-changed-in-how-i-think-about-this">What Changed in How I Think About This</h2>
<p>Before the wipe, I thought the problem was: <em>How do I process more videos faster?</em></p>
<p>After the wipe, I realized the problem was: <em>How do I protect the decisions I&rsquo;ve already made?</em></p>
<p>The assessments—scores that determine whether a video is worth processing—those cost real money. OpenAI tokens aren&rsquo;t free. Re-running thousands of assessments because I didn&rsquo;t think about backups isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;a learning experience.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s expensive stupidity.</p>
<p>And that changed what I cared about:</p>
<p>I stopped experimenting with where my data lives. Experiments happen in throwaway environments now. The production database is not a playground.</p>
<p>I started treating state transitions as events that need approval. Not automation that &ldquo;just runs.&rdquo; If something is going to change the state of 500 videos, I want to see the plan first.</p>
<p>I realized the application isn&rsquo;t the clever part—it&rsquo;s the boring part that makes the clever parts survivable. Symfony isn&rsquo;t exciting. But Doctrine transactions, database constraints, and a UI that shows me what&rsquo;s actually happening? Those make the difference between &ldquo;this might work&rdquo; and &ldquo;I can trust this.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-tools-i-added">The Tools I Added</h2>
<p>The backup script checks the database nightly and creates snapshots. It&rsquo;s not sophisticated. It just works.</p>
<p>The UI has a status dashboard. I can see the processing state at a glance. No more wondering &ldquo;did that finish?&rdquo; or &ldquo;which videos failed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The application enforces a separation: assessment happens in one place, processing happens in another. They&rsquo;re decoupled. If assessment breaks, processing still works with old scores. If processing breaks, I&rsquo;m not re-running expensive assessments.</p>
<p>And I started writing tools that exist solely to monitor the other tools. A script that checks whether the backup ran. A view that shows which videos have been queued for more than 24 hours. A report that flags videos where assessment and processing state don&rsquo;t match.</p>
<p>When you start building tools to watch your tools, you&rsquo;ve crossed a line. You&rsquo;re no longer scripting. You&rsquo;re operating a system.</p>
<h2 id="boundaries-and-non-goals">Boundaries and Non-Goals</h2>
<p>Scripts are still great for exploratory work. This isn&rsquo;t a critique of scripts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not a critique of vibe-coding, but you need to be able to evaluate what gets produced. When you can&rsquo;t tell if the code will break tomorrow, helpful automation becomes dangerous.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t scripts. It&rsquo;s using script-thinking when system-thinking is required.</p>
<h2 id="what-id-do-differently-next-time">What I&rsquo;d Do Differently Next Time</h2>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t wait for a database wipe to add backups. That&rsquo;s the obvious one.</p>
<p>But more importantly, I&rsquo;d recognize the moment when I started wanting to &ldquo;track just one more thing&rdquo; as the signal that state has entered the picture. That&rsquo;s when scripts stop being the right tool.</p>
<p>The question I ask now when I&rsquo;m tempted to add tracking to a script: <em>Is this metadata, or is this state?</em></p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a state, the script is lying to me. It&rsquo;s pretending to be stateless while depending on something that isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="the-signal-youve-built-a-system">The Signal You&rsquo;ve Built a System</h2>
<p>The clearest indicator isn&rsquo;t architectural. It&rsquo;s behavioral.</p>
<p>You start writing tools that monitor your other tools.</p>
<p>You start checking whether things happened, not just whether they succeeded.</p>
<p>You start caring about the <em>order</em> of operations, not just their completion.</p>
<p>You realize &ldquo;just run it again&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a recovery strategy anymore—it&rsquo;s a way to make things worse.</p>
<p>At that point, you&rsquo;re not migrating from scripts to a system. You&rsquo;re admitting you&rsquo;ve been building a system with script-shaped tools, and adjusting accordingly.</p>

I Needed a System.</title><link>https://blog.dazzlog.de/posts/2026-01-17_application-layer-ai-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.dazzlog.de/posts/2026-01-17_application-layer-ai-engineering/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I have a busy familiy life and no time to watch hours of YouTube tutorials. Also, I find the information density very sparse and extracting the information very time-consuming. My <strong>&ldquo;Neo from the Matrix&rdquo; fantasy</strong> has always been to have knowledge injected directly into my brain—skipping the medium and going straight to the data. So my wish formulated that I would like to have the information extracted, so I can expose my brain to the compacted knowledge and speed through all the knowledge I would like my brain to have consumed.</p>
<p>Last summer, I decided to build my way out of that friction.</p>
<h3 id="the-initial-win-and-the-illusion">The Initial Win and the Illusion</h3>
<p>My plan was straightforward and, at the time, I didn&rsquo;t even think of it as an &ldquo;application&rdquo;. I just wanted to feed video transcripts to an AI, extract the information into clean Markdown, and push those files to a Git directory. From there, a static site generator and some GitHub Actions would turn the data into a readable blog post. I wanted something I could consume via a browser or RSS feed, fully replacing the need to watch the video.</p>
<p>The first results were exceptionally good—the AI captured structure and nuance far better than I expected. For a brief moment, it felt like I had solved the problem with just a few clever prompts.</p>
<h3 id="where-reality-disagreed">Where Reality Disagreed</h3>
<p>The friction started almost immediately, and it wasn’t an AI problem—it was a manual effort problem. I found myself trapped in a boring, repetitive cycle of copying video IDs into a Makefile and running Python scripts manually. I was playing &ldquo;human cron job&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As I processed more content, the Markdown files started piling up. Managing the metadata, searching through the directory, and deduplicating entries became significantly harder than generating the content itself. That was the moment I realized that a database wasn&rsquo;t just a &ldquo;nice-to-have&rdquo; feature; it had to be the center of the project.</p>
<h3 id="from-script-to-system">From Script to System</h3>
<p>The turning point was realizing that I didn&rsquo;t want a better script or better prompts; I wanted an agentic system that could discover, ingest, analyze, and publish content without my intervention. I had to move beyond &ldquo;generating text&rdquo; and start &ldquo;operating a workflow&rdquo;. This forced me to shift my thinking toward maintainability and long-term stability.</p>
<p>While I started with Python-based frameworks, I quickly hit a wall of <strong>&ldquo;vibe-trash&rdquo;</strong>—a pile of scattered scripts that were easy to write but impossible to reason about weeks later. I eventually moved the entire project to PHP and Symfony. Moving to my &ldquo;native&rdquo; environment allowed me to own the orchestration layer and build something I could actually debug when things went wrong.</p>

<p>To ensure the system remained safe and queryable, I moved away from ephemeral files toward a more robust stack: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings and Neo4j for knowledge graphs. This wasn’t about over-engineering; it was about building a foundation that could handle the consequences of state, consistency, and scale.</p>

<h3 id="engineering-over-magic">Engineering Over Magic</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what became clear: &ldquo;knowledge extraction&rdquo; sounds like a single AI task. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a pipeline with distinct stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gather</strong> – Fetch transcripts, manage metadata</li>
<li><strong>Normalize</strong> – Chunk at semantic boundaries, disfluency Removal</li>
<li><strong>Transform</strong> – Extract entities and relationships</li>
<li><strong>Store</strong> – Vectors and graphs</li>
<li><strong>Retrieve</strong> – Routed search methods</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Most of these stages have nothing to do with AI.</strong></p>
<p>They are <strong>fundamental</strong>, necessary steps. I stopped looking for the &ldquo;perfect model&rdquo; and started building a TranscriptChunker to preserve timestamps and a database schema that could actually handle metadata.</p>
<p>What surprised me was that AI is most effective when it is given the smallest possible job. I found that chaining specific, isolated AI calls produced far more reliable results than one massive &ldquo;do everything&rdquo; request.</p>

    <div class="admonition-content">If the input data is messy or the early steps in my pipeline are flawed, no amount of clever prompt engineering can save the output downstream.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="the-realization-plumbing-over-prompts">The Realization: Plumbing Over Prompts</h3>
<p>AI fails silently and gracefully. Without proper tracing, I couldn’t tell the difference between an output that &ldquo;looked good&rdquo; and one that actually captured the knowledge I needed. I saw that if I couldn&rsquo;t trace exactly how a piece of knowledge was extracted, I didn&rsquo;t have a system—I just had a demo.</p>
<p>The <strong>architecture surrounding the AI</strong>—the database design, the way I decided to split chunks of text, the preservation of metadata—is where the real engineering happens. These are application problems, and they are where most AI projects quietly fall apart.</p>
<p>I am still figuring out the optimal patterns for this. Structured guidance is scattered across half-finished repos and old blog posts, and I’m still learning how to search for the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to build these systems. But my focus has permanently shifted: I care less about individual prompts and more about the traceable, repeatable system that makes those prompts work.</p>
<p>That is the work that actually scales—and the only way I&rsquo;ll ever get that &ldquo;Neo&rdquo; style knowledge injection.</p>

<p>During my summer vacation 2025, I had a bit of time each evening to hack away at my computer. Since I&rsquo;d been wanting to tackle these projects for a while and felt motivated, I decided to take them on one after another. It wasn&rsquo;t originally planned as &ldquo;one per week&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s the rhythm that naturally emerged from the time I had available, the pace of development, and how long each project actually took. I&rsquo;ll get to what these projects were in a moment, but what I found more important was my goal to develop a solid workflow with <strong>Claude Code</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-zola">Why Zola?</h2>
<p>I wanted to create a technical blog. Previously my blog ran on Jekyll, now on Hugo, but I wanted to see what was currently popular before just defaulting to Hugo. The decision really came down to Hugo or Zola, but then I noticed that Zola uses Jinja2-like syntax for templates. I know Jinja2-style syntax from the Symfony world as Twig, and I can understand it easily — plus anyone who might want to extend the blog in the future (my colleagues also know Twig) can understand it too. That was an important decision criterion for me.</p>
<p>Static site generation means the website is generated upfront and then served as static HTML files. This has performance and security advantages since no database queries or server-side logic are needed. GitHub has been offering GitHub Pages for this for years, and it&rsquo;s incredibly simple to host a static website.</p>

<p>Since there was no technical blog before, I could start completely fresh without any legacy concerns. I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with Zola yet and how it works, so I decided after a bit of research on the <strong>DeepThought</strong> theme, which I liked and also provided a good foundation for OPEN Software Consulting&rsquo;s corporate identity.</p>
<p>I gave Claude the brand colors and that&rsquo;s how the current design of the site emerged. My workflow with Claude Code involved creating a <code>PLAN.md</code> file where I listed all the tasks I wanted to complete. I then kept updating this file and prompted Claude to take a task from the file, work on it, read the file (in case it had changed), check it off, commit, and then take the next task. This helped me keep track of everything and also document the work steps.</p>

<h3 id="reading-time">Reading Time</h3>
<p>Something I hadn&rsquo;t thought of at all was reading time for blog posts. This is a feature Claude suggested and I really like it. Claude helped me calculate the reading time for each blog post and store it in the frontmatter. This was super practical because I could then display the reading time directly in the blog posts. There&rsquo;s now also a Claude Code command <code>/project:audit-reading-time</code> that calculates reading time for all blog posts and stores it in the frontmatter.</p>
<h3 id="teamauthors">Team/Authors</h3>
<p>Since I created the site for OPEN Software Consulting, I also wanted to include team members as authors. For this, I created a <code>/project:team-add-member</code> command that allows me to add team members and create their profiles. This is super practical because I can easily manage team members and update their profiles. Under <code>/team/</code> you can find the team members and their profiles, which I created with Claude Code. Each author also has a list of their blog posts that they&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>I also wanted to include the Symfony User Group events that we&rsquo;ve been organizing for years. For this, I created a <code>/project:events-add-event</code> command that allows me to add events and manage their details. The events are displayed under <code>/events/</code> and are organized in the same structure as blog posts. This makes it easy to manage events and display them on the website.</p>
<h3 id="taxonomies">Taxonomies</h3>
<p>I learned these are super important for structuring content. I created taxonomies for authors, categories, and tags to better organize the blog posts. Zola does a fantastic job making tags, categories, and authors easily browsable.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>Zola has a built-in search function that I activated for the blog. This is super practical because readers can quickly find the content they&rsquo;re looking for. I also created a <code>/project:posts-validate-content</code> command that ensures all blog posts are correctly formatted and contain no errors.</p>
<h3 id="additional-features">Additional Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookie Banner</strong>: Implemented to comply with privacy regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Admonition Macro</strong>: For special notices in blog posts.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The design is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Hero Images</strong>: Each blog post has a hero image defined in the frontmatter.</li>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Pages</strong>: Pages that display all blog posts and events by categories and tags.</li>
<li><strong>SEO Optimization</strong>: Blog posts are optimized for search engines to ensure better visibility.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: The website is designed to be accessible to all users.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: The website is fast and responsive since it&rsquo;s statically generated.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when code changes are made.</li>
<li><strong>Content Validation</strong>: A command that ensures all content is correctly formatted and contains no errors.</li>
<li><strong>Markdown Support</strong>: All content is written in Markdown, making editing and maintenance easier.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax Highlighting</strong>: Code snippets in blog posts are automatically highlighted to improve readability (without line numbers).</li>
<li><strong>Table of Contents (ToC)</strong>: Automatically generated table of contents for blog posts that enable better navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I was amazed that I was done with the site after 5 days. And that&rsquo;s even though I only had a few hours each evening to work on it. I learned a lot about Zola and how taxonomies work. I also learned how easy it is with Claude Code to quickly get a simple project up and running. I hadn&rsquo;t known <strong>Bulma CSS</strong> before, but it&rsquo;s a lightweight CSS framework that works well with Zola and helped me quickly create an appealing design.</p>
<div class="details admonition info open">

<p>In four days, this project went from zero to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>67 commits</strong> (averaging 16 commits per day)</li>
<li><strong>2 blog posts</strong> with comprehensive content</li>
<li><strong>5 event pages</strong> with real community data</li>

<h2 id="project-2-c-base-artefakt-guide">Project 2: c-base Artefakt-Guide</h2>
<p>The c-base artifact guide is a guide to the discovered artifacts of c-base for members of <strong>c-base, the crashed space station under Berlin-Mitte</strong>. The relaunch was necessary because the old website was outdated and no longer met requirements. The connection to c-base&rsquo;s LDAP system no longer worked and the PHP libraries were so outdated that they could no longer be updated. A website relaunch I had planned was <strong>not completed twice</strong>, so I decided to recreate the website with Zola.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s missing now is the editing functionality for members, but I consider that a feature that can be added later. The website is now static and maintained by c-base members by updating the Markdown files in the repository. I did a bit of research - there are even UIs for sites stored in Git that allow content editing, but I decided not to set that up for now because it makes things technically more complex again and the project should first be relaunched in a simple version. One challenge is that the URLs must remain the same, since we have QR codes hanging on board that scan to the artifact guide for specific artifacts.</p>
<p>This time too, I created an initial document with Claude Code where I described in great detail what I wanted to do. The goal, current status, and desired end state. I already knew I wanted to use Zola, but for this project the layout was so specific that a ready-made theme would have mostly gotten in the way. After brief research, I decided on a custom theme. With <strong>TailwindCSS and DaisyUI</strong>, because both are on my list of things I want to gain experience with. This would later give me headaches and delay the project.</p>
<p>One requirement I set for every project is that they don&rsquo;t depend on any external sources in production. No CDNs for fonts, CSS, or JavaScript libraries. All resources are delivered statically with the site. But I still started with TailwindCSS delivered via CDN and postponed the problem of not finding a proper way to include it until later.</p>
<div class="details admonition failure open">
  <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
    <i class="icon ">&#xf057;</i> TailwindCSS needs npm or CDN<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i>
  </div>
  <div class="details-content">
    <div class="admonition-content">Tailwind needs a JavaScript (npm) build step to parse existing CSS for used classes and save them in a CSS file. Either the JavaScript comes via CDN that parses my site at runtime (and tracks all users), or I install npm and the JavaScript libraries to parse locally.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>For me, this mainly means that TailwindCSS becomes unusable, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>My deploy process should be as simple as possible</li>
<li>npm is hell and I won&rsquo;t voluntarily let it into my house. It opens a dependency hell that becomes outdated and opens security vulnerabilities as soon as you don&rsquo;t update for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>End of story.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the layout had to be recreated from scratch. Once that was clear, I gave Claude the task of migrating the existing layout to Bulma (which we already know). That took a few minutes until everything fit, and I had to help out quite a bit, and after running into the usage limit at least twice, the layout was sleek, I liked it, and it wasn&rsquo;t dependent on anything or anyone anymore.</p>
<p><img src="c-base-artefakt-guide.jpg" alt="c-base-artefakt-guide.jpg" title="c-base Artefakt Guide, c_o:n, oder?"></p>
<p>This project contains a long list of features:</p>
<h3 id="multilingual-with-c-lang">Multilingual with c-lang</h3>
<div class="details admonition tldr open">
  <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
    <i class="icon ">&#xf259;</i> c-lang<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i>
  </div>
  <div class="details-content">
    <div class="admonition-content">c-lang is the constructed language of the c-base space station. The escalation system (0-3) provides increasing complexity from basic member communication to advanced c-lang usage.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Since c-lang isn&rsquo;t ISO standard, normal multilingual features can&rsquo;t handle it, and it took a while until I found an approach that wasn&rsquo;t cumbersome, didn&rsquo;t require writing markup in Markdown, or put all texts in the TOML configuration. Since most multilingual features change the URL per language, that wasn&rsquo;t an option, because the URL had to be fixed due to the QR codes pointing to them.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s solved by having a separate file for each language and making the switch in the template. The main configuration is done in the default language, German and English only adjust the title.</p>
<h3 id="taxonomy-for-decc-location-and-ring">Taxonomy for <code>decc</code>, <code>location</code> and <code>ring</code></h3>
<p>Now you can browse the list of artifacts from the <code>oberdecc</code> or the <code>culture</code> ring. This also generates the next artifact that invites further browsing.</p>
<h3 id="image-credits-and-image-carousel">Image Credits and Image Carousel</h3>
<p>Image credits are preserved. The images were previously stored in a database and linked to artifacts with an n:m relation. Without a database, this now becomes denormalized into a 1:n relation: Each artifact has many images. The images are entered in the article&rsquo;s TOML config. The number of images determines whether a carousel is shown or just the image without control elements and pagination.</p>
<p><img src="c-base-artefakt-guide_artefact.jpg" alt="c-base-artefakt-guide_artefact.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>The project is packaged into a Docker image via GitHub Actions and pushed to GitHub&rsquo;s Container Registry tagged as latest. Then a webhook is called that ensures a script on a c-base server pulls
the image and starts a container from it. Wasn&rsquo;t a problem at all, but something new to learn from GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>I would have liked to avoid the TailwindCSS route, but I&rsquo;m glad I went through it because now I don&rsquo;t have to make the same journey in my project at work and already know that Bulma is the alternative.</p>
<p>Claude helped with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the custom layout, twice</li>
<li>The trilingual language switch without ready-made language features</li>
<li>Content migration of existing artifacts and their images</li>
<li>Scripts and commands to check:
<ul>
<li>Valid frontmatter</li>
<li>Valid taxonomies</li>
<li>All registered images are present and all existing images are registered</li>
<li>All links work</li>
<li>All translations are present</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Detailed documentation</li>
<li>CI/CD with GitHub Actions</li>
</ul>
<p>The project was super fun and quite a bit more time needs to be invested to claim the artifact guide is finished, because with this project, content is king. The site is a feast for the eyes and does justice to the space station. A good moment for a relaunch, because the space station turns 30 this year!</p>

<h2 id="project-3-relaunch-berliner-php-usergroup-website">Project 3: Relaunch Berliner PHP Usergroup Website</h2>
<p>The Berlin PHP User Group site was created in 2011, before that it was a wiki (?). <strong>Jekyll</strong> was used, which was state-of-the-art at the time. The site has, as mentioned, gotten long in the tooth and I had no desire to maintain an old site after taking over the organization of the Berlin PHP Usergroup.</p>
<div class="details admonition info open">
  <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
    <i class="icon ">&#xf05a;</i> Jekyll<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i>
  </div>
  <div class="details-content">
    <div class="admonition-content"><p>Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. It&rsquo;s written in Ruby and was one of the first SSGs that you could use with GitHub Pages.</p>

</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>I analyzed the content of the old site and found that it would be better to represent the &ldquo;&ldquo;Archive&rdquo; as the list of events, which is what the usergroup is all about, since a Markdown page was diligently created each time. Many events also include slides and source files that speakers had uploaded. I wasn&rsquo;t sure at first whether we should keep them, but after seeing that it was under 100MB, the question was off the table and the answer was a clear &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together with Claude, I created a spec until everything I envisioned was correctly listed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Zola SSG with custom theme using Bulma CSS</li>
<li>PHP colors</li>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>List of all events</li>
<li>Taxonomy for speakers and topics</li>
</ol>
<p>I first imported one event, checked that everything fit, then we imported 5 more events from the old repository and more adjustments had to be made. Then I had to take a break for the day because
I hit Claude&rsquo;s token limit. After that I just had Claude to its thing importing all events and deciding on the topics for each event. I would never have tried to do this if it wasn&rsquo;t for a helping
hand from AI.</p>
<p><img src="bephpug_relaunch_2.jpg" alt="bephpug_relaunch_2.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="events-1">Events</h3>
<p>Thanks to the simple structure, you can now easily view all past events and browse the topics and speakers for each event.</p>
<p><img src="bephpug_relaunch_events.jpg" alt="bephpug_relaunch_events.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="speaker">Speaker</h3>
<p>Each speaker has their own page listing all events where they gave a presentation.

<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-all-3-projects">What I Learned from all 3 projects</h2>
<p><strong>Why &ldquo;staying out of the way&rdquo; is an underestimated feature:</strong>
Zola&rsquo;s simplicity meant I spent time solving actual problems rather than fighting the tool. When technology doesn&rsquo;t create friction, you can focus on what matters - the content and user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Bare minimum first:</strong>
There are a ton of features that can be added, but they all make the project more complex and introduce possible bugs. Keeping it simple and doing only the bare minimum to have the project
shippable was a fun achievement.</p>
<p><strong>How different projects help you really understand a tool:</strong>
Each project pushed different boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project 1 taught me Zola basics and taxonomies</li>
<li>Project 2 forced me into custom themes and multilingual complexity</li>
<li>Project 3 showed me content migration and community site patterns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for other developers wanting to start with Zola:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with an existing theme for your first project to understand the patterns</li>
<li>Embrace the simplicity - don&rsquo;t over-engineer from the start</li>
<li>Use taxonomies liberally - they&rsquo;re powerful for content organization</li>
<li>Co-locate assets with content when possible</li>
<li>The template system is intuitive if you know Jinja2/Twig</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary--outlook">Summary &amp; Outlook</h2>
<p><strong>Quick retrospective: 3 websites – check.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key insight: A good tool is one that allows you to implement your ideas quickly.</strong></p>
<p>Three weeks of evening development resulted in three production (ready) websites, each serving real communities and solving actual problems. The combination of Claude Code&rsquo;s intelligent assistance with Zola&rsquo;s straightforward architecture created a development experience that felt more like guided conversation than traditional programming.</p>
<p>The pattern that emerged wasn&rsquo;t planned but proved effective: detailed planning documents, iterative development with AI assistance, and focus on shipping functional solutions over perfect implementations. Sometimes the best workflow is the one that naturally evolves from the constraints you&rsquo;re working within.</p>
