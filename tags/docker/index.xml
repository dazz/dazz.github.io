To make use of s6-overlay we need to add the binaries to our container by adding, extracting and then moving them to the directory where they are expected.

Actions are basically hooks that can start CI/DC workflows on repository events.
GitHub actions can be used to build and push images to GitHubâ€™s Container Registry which are reachable under https://ghcr.io which is part of the package registry. The package registry is not only for docker images, it can also host quite a few other kinds of packages.</description></item></channel></rss>
