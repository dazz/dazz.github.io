i must admit i did not look far, it was more a zeitgeist thing that just ran my way.\nsomeone mentioned hugo as a blog that you can easily publish to from obsidian, i\u0026rsquo;m not planning on using that particular feature, but i looked hugo up, and it seems that it is exactly what i was to lazy to look for. a static site generator that uses markdown and can be build by github actions.\nthere is already a huge list of possible themes and many look promising from the thumbnail, but feature wise there is a huge difference. what to look out for:\nhow far is the template deviating from the default, in case you ever want to change the template. which features do you want/need and are they already included, is it complicated to add them later? are there existing installations that are actively used, so they can be used as a reference is there a reference/documentation on how to install it on the host how do you publish new content, are there examples/documentation? what is the version of the technologies in the deploy chain, old? for every point there is also the question of how complicated each step is.\nas a reference, this is what i ended up doing:\nlocal setup install hugo sudo apt-get install hugo create a new site see the official quick start for more infos.\nhugo new site dazz.github.io cd dazz.github.io git init add a theme look at all the blog themes hugo already has listed.\ni chose hugo-ficurinia as it has the following enabled: tags, categories, fonts i like, simply deploys and looks as promised.\nadd the theme as submodule:\ngit submodule add https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia themes/hugo-ficurinia and run a local server to test everything\nhugo server -t hugo-ficurinia add a blog post there is probably nothing much to see, so let\u0026rsquo;s add a new post as draft.\nhugo new posts/hello-world/index.md make sure to read about how to organize the content in directories.\nrun the server and run the server again and also include the draft post\nhugo server -t hugo-ficurinia --builddrafts when you run just hugo -t hugo-ficurinia the site will be build and dumped to public/. that is what we will later do to deploy the site.\ntime to commit all the changed files and add the remote to push everything\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:dazz/dazz.github.io.git git push origin main there will nothing happen yet as we still need to add the github workflow\ndeploy to github pages via github actions mkdir -p .github/workflows touch .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml # file: .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml name: \u0026#34;build and deploy gh-pages\u0026#34; on: push: branches: - main paths-ignore: - .gitignore - readme.md - license # allows you to run this workflow manually from the actions tab workflow_dispatch: permissions: contents: write # needed to push to the gh-pages branch pages: write id-token: write # allow one concurrent deployment concurrency: group: \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34; cancel-in-progress: true jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: # step 1 - checks-out your repository under $github_workspace - name: checkout uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: fetch-depth: 0 submodules: true # step 2 - sets up the latest version of hugo - name: hugo setup uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.6.0 with: extended: true hugo-version: \u0026#39;latest\u0026#39; # step 3 - adds a cache - uses: actions/cache@v2 with: path: /tmp/hugo_cache key: ${{ runner.os }}-hugomod-${{ hashfiles(\u0026#39;**/go.sum\u0026#39;) }} restore-keys: | ${{ runner.os }}-hugomod- # step 4 - clean and don\u0026#39;t fail - name: clean public directory run: rm -rf public/* # step 5 - builds the site using the latest version of hugo # also specifies the theme we want to use - name: build run: hugo --minify --theme=hugo-ficurinia # step 6 - push our generated site to our gh-pages branch - name: github pages action uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.9.0 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.github_token }} publish_dir: ./public cname: dazz.github.io read more about the options you get when using peaceiris/actions-hugo and peaceiris/actions-gh-pages.\ncustomization now the customization party can start. all the options are listed in the config.toml.\nhappy blogging \\o/ ","title":"Goodbye Jekyll, hello Hugo"},{"date":"2022-12-26","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://dazz.github.io/posts/2022-12-26_hello-world/","summary":"Introduction This is bold text, and this is emphasized text.\nVisit the Hugo website!","tags":[],"text":"introduction this is bold text, and this is emphasized text.\nvisit the hugo website!\n","title":"Hello, world!"},{"date":"0001-01-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://dazz.github.io/about/","summary":"Logo Bild von catalyststuff auf Freepik","tags":[],"text":"logo bild von catalyststuff auf freepik\n","title":""}]}
